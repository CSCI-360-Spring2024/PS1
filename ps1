 1. (a) Intelligence: Intelligence is like your brain's superhero power – it's the ability to soak in knowledge, solve problems, and navigate new situations. Smart folks are good at reasoning, learning, and grasping complex ideas.
(b) Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is like teaching computers to be as savvy as humans. Think of it as making machines talk, solve problems, learn, and see things – all the cool stuff humans can do.
(c) Rationality: Being rational is like making decisions with your thinking cap on. It's about weighing the pros and cons, considering all the facts, and choosing the most sensible path – being a smart decision-maker.
(d) Epistemic Rationality: Epistemic rationality is all about being wise in what you know. It's about forming beliefs and soaking in knowledge in a way that just makes sense – being on the right side of logic.
(e) Instrumental Rationality: Instrumental rationality is like choosing the smartest moves to reach your goals. It's all about picking actions that get you where you want to go – being efficient and effective in what you do.
(f) Reasoning: Reasoning is like your brain's detective work. It's about putting puzzle pieces together, drawing conclusions, and making sense of the world – being a mental problem-solver. (g) Logic: Logic is like the rulebook for good thinking. It helps you make arguments and draw conclusions that just click – a bit like math and philosophy having a logical lovechild.
(h) Logical Reasoning: Logical reasoning is like using the cheat codes for thinking. It's about looking at info, spotting patterns, and drawing conclusions that just make sense by being a savvy thinker.
(i) Artificial General Intelligence: Artificial General Intelligence is like teaching machines to be super versatile brains. It's about making AI that understands, learns, and tackles all kinds of tasks – being the jack-of-all-trades in the machine world.
(j) Artificial Super Intelligence: Artificial Super Intelligence is like the boss level of AI. Imagine machines being way smarter than us at everything – that's ASI, the rockstar of the AI world. It's cool but kinda makes you think about the future, too.
2. Turing's AI and Turing Test ideas still stir debates. Old objections stick around, and new worries like ethics and bias join the party. Turing bet a computer would be 30% Test-ready by 2000 – not quite there. Today, AI's got game but falls short on the real understanding front. Fast forward 50 years? AI might get close to human smarts, but the big question of genuine understanding remains.

 3. The argument revolves around the Neats-Scruffies debate in cognitive science, which contrasts those who favor formal mathematical models (Neats) with those advocating for a more holistic, real-world approach (Scruffies). Neats contend that complex math accurately describes cognitive processes, even if individuals are unaware. Scruffies stress considering real-world interactions and recognizing the limitations of relying solely on advanced mathematical models to explain cognition.
4. Some folks say intelligence is all about kick-butt perception and motor skills, seeing the fancier cognitive stuff as just extras. Nature and a big chunk of our brains are all about being top-notch in what we see and how we move. The challenge for AI is nailing real-world smarts, where recognizing things and moving around aren't as easy as acing a game. Maybe it's time for AI to shift gears and put more effort into rocking the basics of perceiving and dealing with the real deal.
5. Most of the things mentioned in the question can definitely or have already been solved by means of computers. For example, ping pong and table tennis have made advancements in the field of AI already. However, driving in Cairo is far more unpredictable and the AI studies have not gotten that far enough to be able to conquer by means of computers.
6. (a) Philosophy of Mind:
AI dives into the whole Philosophy of Mind gig, asking deep questions about consciousness and intelligence. It makes us ponder if machines can really think like humans. Essentially, AI sparks a philosophical debate about the nature of thought, self-awareness, and how smart machines can get.
(b) Cognitive Science:
AI and Cognitive Science are like two buddies sharing secrets. They learn from each other to crack the code of how our minds work. AI borrows ideas from cognitive science theories to build smart systems, and, in return, it throws cool insights back at cognitive scientists. It's this sweet back-and-forth that helps us understand human thinking better.
(c) Cybernetics:

 Think of AI and Cybernetics as partners in crime. Cybernetics teaches AI how living things and machines communicate and control stuff. AI, especially in robotics, leans on cybernetic principles for self-learning and adapting. It's like giving machines the ability to regulate themselves, and it's a game-changer.
(d) Information Theory:
AI and Information Theory are the ultimate data dream team. Information Theory is all about managing and squeezing value from data, and AI thrives on that. From pattern recognition to language processing, AI owes a lot to the principles of Information Theory. They're the duo making sense of the data chaos.
(e) Physics:
AI and Physics are like partners in discovery. AI helps robots navigate the real world, and in simulations, it's a powerhouse for predicting outcomes. In physics experiments, AI crunches the numbers, finds patterns, and makes sense of the data flood. It's the perfect tag team for unraveling the mysteries of the physical universe.
